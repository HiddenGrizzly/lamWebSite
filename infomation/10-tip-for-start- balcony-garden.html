        <h1>10 GOOD REASONS TO START A TERRACE GARDEN</h1>
        <p>
            You may think that gardening is an ideal activity for your grandpa or grandma
            because they have time on their hands and can afford to idle it away on plants.
            Or maybe you live in a small apartment and have no space to set up your
            garden. Or it is your jet-setting lifestyle that's in the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever your excuse for not starting a garden, you're missing out on a ton of
            great benefits that it affords. If you are cooking up excuses why you shouldn't
            start a garden, stop it right now and start counting the 10 good reasons why
            you should start a terrace garden in your home.
        </p>
        <h2>1. COOK TASTY AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD</h2>
        <div class="info-block">
            <p class="info-text">
                Well, the most obvious reason why you'd want to start your own garden is
                that vegetables grown in
                your own garden are fresh
                and free from chemicals and
                pesticides that are sprayed in
                shop-bought items. <br> Fresh
                ingredients also add more taste to your meals and offers better nutritional
                value. There is nothing quite like biting into a fresh juicy tomato or making
                lemonade from a freshly plucked lime and fragrant mint.

        <h2>2. COOK MORE VEGETABLES</h2>
        <div class="info-block">
            <p class="info-text">
                If you don’t have a garden at home, chances are you are buying more meat and 
                junk food from the supermarket. On the other hand, home-grown vegetables
                give you a personal interest in eating what your harvested. Tell your kids to
                eat their greens and they’ll throw a fit. But ask them to grow their own greens and
                other veggies and they can’t wait to eat the work of their hands. 
                <br>
                Growing your own vegetable garden can help kids develop the right attitude
                towards fresh fruits and vegetables and encourage them to automatically eat
                the right foods from a young age.
            </p>

        <h2>3. BURN CALORIES AND STAY FIT</h2>
        <div class="info-block">
            <p class="info-text">
                If you have a desk job, chances are you never get up from your seat unless you
                absolutely have to. You work at your desk and eat while you work so you can
                get more work done. At the end of the day, you end up with an eye strain,
                cramped muscles and spinal problems. 
                <br>
                Studies indicate that spending one hour on moderate gardening activities like
                planting and weeding can burn between 200-400 calories but if you’re hauling
                soil up your terrace and doing some intensive work, you could lose as much as
                600 calories per hour.

        <h2>4. GET MORE VITAMIN D</h2>
        <div class="info-block">
            <p class="info-text">
                You are probably aware that Vitamin D is not naturally produced in the body and
                the lack of it may leads to several illnesses like heart disease, multiple
                sclerosis and depression. Vitamin D also helps strengthen bones, regulates insulin
                levels and promotes good cardiovascular
                health among other things. A few hours of exposure in the sun can give you
                the necessary Vitamin D fix the natural way, so why not take it?
            </p>

        <h2>5. GET STRONG HANDS</h2>
        <div class="info-block">
            <p class="info-text">
                This may sound like a silly thing, but you’d be surprised how much you take
                your hand strength for granted. As you grow older, you lose strength in your
                arms. Keeping your fingers nimble and routinely pruning, pinching and
                working with your hands in the garden will give you stronger grip and keep your
                hands strong for a long time to come. This is important as poor grip strength is 
                associated with premature mortality.

        <h2>6. CONNECT WITH GOOD BACTERIA</h2>
        <div class="info-block">
            <p class="info-text">
                Today, we live in a world of hyper-cleanliness to the point where we have
                cleaned away all the good bacteria that kept out many diseases. Gardening
                brings us back into contact with them. One such bacteria is Mycobacterium
                Vaccae, which is found in the soil and gives off that beautiful earthy smell
                when it rains.
                <br>
                When you do gardening, you tend to take in this bacteria, which has the effect of
                strengthening your immune system and making your body less susceptible to
                inflammation. These bacteria are also said to increase the levels of serotonin, which is a chemical in the brain responsible
                for mood regulation, thereby acting as an antidepressant of sort (without the side effects!)
